# Introduction

An app used to upscale your images. This app uses the [SR-LUT](https://github.com/yhjo09/SR-LUT) algorithm to upscale your images. The app is built using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) framework and the [Dart](https://dart.dev/) programming language.

# Getting Started

This project is is my first attempt at using Flutter and Dart for Android development.

To build this project, you will need to have the Flutter SDK installed on your machine. You can find the installation instructions [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

Then you can build the project using the following command:

```bash 
flutter build apk
```
